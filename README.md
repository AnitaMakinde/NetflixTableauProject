# 🎥 Netflix Tableau Visualisation Project (2008-2020)

Welcome to my **Netflix Tableau Visualisation Project**! This project explores Netflix's content globally between **2008 and 2020**, focusing on the type of content, countries, and genres. 🎥🌍

## 🚀 Project Overview

Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services with 283 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and, in more recent years, games across a wide variety of genres and languages.
The aim of this project was to create an interactive dashboard to display Netflix’s content strategy in order to get an understanding of the content available.

## 🔧 Tools and Techniques

- **Excel**:  
  - 🧹 *Data Cleaning*: Removed duplicates, formatted the data, and handled missing values.  
  - 🔍 *Filtering*: Focused on specific industries, cities, and sub-industries for deeper analysis.  

- **Tableau**:  
  - 🖼️ *Data Visualization*: Created interactive dashboards to bring the data to life
